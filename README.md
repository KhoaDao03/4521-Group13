Group members: James Hugglestone, Trent Guillen, Nathan Wallen, Khoa Dao, Chris Canty.

## Description: 
The Healthcare Information Management System is a web application designed to make handling patient healthcare information simpler and more secure. It serves three main user roles: doctors, patients, and a database manager. Each user has their own profile, which can be accessed by both doctors and the patients themselves to manage health data effectively. The system focuses on security and uses techniques like Secure Computing along with Distributed Computing for other site operations. This ensures that patient records are both safe and easy to access, meeting the crucial need for privacy and efficiency in managing healthcare information.

How to split the workload: 
We'll start by identifying the components (front/back end) of the web application.
Then we'll split up the workload based on our strengths and preferences and communicate with each other regularly.
