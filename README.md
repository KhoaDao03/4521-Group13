Project Title: Healthcare Information Management System.

Description: 
A Web application that involves a database managing patients' healthcare information.
There will be two roles in the web applications doctor and the patient.
Each user will have a profile that can be accessed by doctors and the patients themselves. The information can be secured through Secure Computing with Distributed/ Parallel Computing for other operations of the website. 

How to split the workload: 
We'll start by identifying the components (front/back end) of the web application.
Then we'll split up the workload based on our strengths and preferences and communicate with each other regularly.
