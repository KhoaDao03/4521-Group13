Distribution Plan

Introduction: This document outlines the planned approach for deploying our 
Healthcare Information Management System on a cloud platform. We will use 
cloud technologies to enhance the scalability, reliability, and accessibility
of our application for healthcare providers. 

Docker: For our healthcare information management system, selecting the right 
container is very important to ensure efficient deployment and scalability. If 
we were to containerize and deploy your project on the cloud we would use Docker, 
it would easily be the best for the following reasons: 

User Friendly: Docker is known to be one of the easiest to use container 
applications. Commands for container management are simple and straightforward. 
Therefore even if members of the group were unfamiliar with the software, it would 
be easy for them to pick it up.

Compatibility: Docker also supports a wide range of operating systems and programming 
languages, there would be no problems with containerizing our application with them. 

Scalability and Security: Scalability would also be very important for distributing 
our program. Docker’s model allows users to easily scale their applications. Also, 
because of Docker’s extensive security features, it would allow us to maintain a secure 
environment which is essential in a healthcare information system. 

Containerization Steps with Docker: Dockerfiles Creation: We will create Dockerfiles 
for each component of our application, the user interface, server-side logic, and 
database. These files will specify how to build Docker images that contain our application 
environments. 

Image Building: Using the Dockerfiles, we will build images for each part of the 
application. These images will be stored in a Docker registry for deployment. 

Local Testing: Before deploying, we’ll run these containers locally on our machines 
to ensure everything works as expected without environment-specific issues. 

General Cloud Deployment: Our deployment target will be a cloud platform that supports 
Docker, which gives us flexibility in choosing providers like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure, 
depending on cost, features, and scalability needs: 

Cloud Setup: We will set up a service like AWS, Google Kubernetes Engine, or Azure 
Kubernetes Service to manage our Docker containers. This involves configuring the cloud 
environment, including network settings and security measures. 

Container Deployment: We will deploy our Docker containers onto the cloud service. This 
step will connect our application with cloud-specific resources and services necessary 
for full functionality. 

Securing the Deployment: Proper security measures, including firewalls and managing access 
permissions, will be established to protect data and resources. 

Auto Scaling and Load Balancing: The cloud platform will be configured to automatically 
scale the application by adjusting the number of active instances based on user demand. 
Load balancing will be used to distribute user requests efficiently across these instances. 

Monitoring and Logging: Using tools provided by the cloud platform, we will monitor 
application performance and health. Logging services will help in collecting and analyzing 
for maintenance. 

Cost Management: We will optimize costs by selecting suitable instance types, utilizing spot 
instances or reserved instances, and regularly monitoring our expenditure with tools like 
the respective cloud provider’s cost management solutions. 

Change Management: We will provide details on the process for future updates and changes to 
the system. We will also discuss how the changes will be tested and implemented into the 
system without disrupting or breaking existing services. 

User Authentication and Authorization: We would determine how user access will be controlled 
and managed. We could discuss multi-factor authentication (MFA) and role-based access 
controls (RBAC). We could potentially include the use of identity and access management 
(IAM) systems. 

Conclusion: The deployment of our Healthcare Information Management System on a cloud platform 
using Docker will provide an extensive framework to meet the needs of healthcare providers. 
This strategy ensures a successful deployment with optimal performance, security, and 
exceptional flexibility, positioning our system to effectively support healthcare operations 
and enhance patient care outcomes.
